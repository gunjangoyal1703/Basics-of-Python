# **Basics-of-Python**

## **AIM** <br>
To study the Python programming environment and interface, understand execution modes, variables, data types, operators, and basic input/output operations in Python.
<br>
## **OBJECTIVES**<br>
•	To understand the Python programming environment and interface<br>
•	To study Python execution modes<br>
•	To understand comments in Python<br>
•	To learn variables, identifier rules, and data types<br>
•	To study different operators and expressions<br>
•	To understand basic input and output mechanisms<br>
## **THEORY**<br>
### **1. Python Environment and Interface**<br>
The Python environment provides tools and interfaces to write, execute, and debug Python programs. Python programs can be executed using different interfaces such as:<br>
•	Python Shell<br>
•	Jupyter Notebook<br>
•	Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Spyder, PyCharm, and VS Code<br>
•	Cloud-based platforms like Google Colab<br>
The interface allows users to write code, execute instructions, and view results interactively.<br>
### **2. Python Execution Modes**<br>
Python supports two main execution modes:<br>
#### **a) Interactive Mode**<br>
•	Commands are executed one line at a time<br>
•	Immediate output is displayed<br>
•	Useful for testing small code snippets and learning<br>
Examples: Python shell, Jupyter Notebook cells, Google Colab<br>
#### **b) Script Mode**<br>
•	Programs are written in a file and executed as a whole<br>
•	Suitable for developing complete applications<br>
•	Files usually have .py extension<br>
### **3. Comments in Python**<br>
Comments are non-executable statements used to explain code and improve readability.<br>
•	**Single-line comments:** Begin with #<br>
•	**Multi-line comments:** Written using triple quotes (""" """)<br>
Comments help in documentation and understanding program logic.<br>
### **4. Variables and Identifiers**<br>
A variable is a named memory location used to store data values.<br>
Rules for Identifiers:<br>
•	Must start with a letter (A–Z, a–z) or underscore _<br>
•	Cannot start with a digit<br>
•	Case-sensitive<br>
•	Should not use Python keywords<br>
Python uses dynamic typing, meaning variables do not require explicit data type declaration.<br>
### **5. Data Types in Python**<br>
Python provides several built-in data types to store different kinds of data.<br>
Basic Data Types<br>
•	**Integer (int):** Whole numbers<br>
•	**Floating-point (float):** Decimal numbers<br>
•	**String (str):** Sequence of characters<br>
•	**Boolean (bool):** True or False<br>
The data type of a variable can be identified using the type() function.<br>
### **6. Operators and Expressions**<br>
Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.<br>
Types of Operators<br>
•	**Arithmetic Operators: **Used for mathematical calculations<br>
(+, -, *, /, %)<br>
•	**Relational Operators:** Used for comparison<br>
(>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)<br>
•**	Logical Operators:** Used to combine conditions<br>
(and, or, not)<br>
•**	Assignment Operators: **Used to assign values<br>
(=, +=, -=, *=, /=)<br>
•	**Bitwise Operators:** Perform operations at bit level<br>
(&, |, ^, <<, >>)<br>
An expression is a combination of operators and operands that produces a result.<br>
### **7. Basic Input and Output Operations**<br>
Input and output operations allow interaction between the user and the program.<br>
•	**Input:**<br>
input() function is used to accept input from the user.<br>
Input is treated as a string by default and may require type conversion.<br>
•	**Output:**<br>
print() function is used to display output.<br>
Formatted output can be achieved using commas or formatted strings.<br>
## **CONCLUSION**<br>
Thus, the Python programming environment, execution modes, variables, data types, operators, and basic input/output operations were studied and understood.<br>
